          Aplication
          <ol className={styles.subList}>
            <li>
              The following Standard Terms and Conditions of Delivery and
              Business (from now on referred to as the Standard Terms and
              Conditions) shall apply to all orders, offers, deliveries and
              services executed by Yvonne Schmedemann (from now on referred to
              as the photographer).
            </li>

            <li>
              They shall be deemed to have been agreed upon the clients
              acceptance of the photographers delivery, service or offer, but no
              later than the clients acceptance of the photographic material for
              publication.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the client wishes to object to the General Terms and
              Conditions, this must be declared in writing within three working
              days. Any deviating terms and conditions of the client are hereby
              rejected. Deviating terms and conditions of the client shall not
              apply unless the photographer accepts them in writing.
            </li>
            <li>
              The General Terms and Conditions shall also apply to all future
              orders, quotations, deliveries, and services of the Photographer
              within the framework of an ongoing business relationship, even
              without express inclusion, unless expressly agreed otherwise.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
          Commissioned productions
          <ol className={styles.subList}>
            <li>
              Should cost increases occur during production, the photographer
              shall only notify the client if it becomes apparent that the
              originally estimated total costs are likely to be exceeded by more
              than 15%. If the planned production time is exceeded for reasons
              for which the photographer is not responsible, additional
              remuneration shall be payable on the basis of the agreed
              time-based fee or in the form of a reasonable increase in the
              fixed fee.
            </li>
            <li>
              Concepts commissioned by the client are independent services that
              are to be remunerated.
            </li>
            <li>
              The photographer is authorised to commission the services of third
              parties, which must be purchased in order to carry out the
              production, on behalf of, and with the authorisation of and for
              the account of the client.
            </li>
            <li>
              The client’s briefing forms the basis for the photographs and
              calculations to be produced by the photographer. The briefing must
              be provided by the client to the photographer in full,
              conclusively and in writing (e.g. as written minutes of a meeting,
              by email). In the event that the client does not provide the
              photographer with a written briefing, the pre-production meeting
              (PPM), any prior email correspondence between the client and
              photographer, and the photographer’s notes from the PPM and
              telephone calls shall form the basis for the production of the
              photographs.
            </li>
            <li>
              The client or their authorised representatives are required to be
              present during the production of the photographs and to give their
              consent to the photographer’s creative concept. The final decision
              shall rest with the photographer. If neither the client nor their
              authorised representatives are present at the time of the
              shooting, the client may not subsequently object to the artistic
              design of the work. In such a case, each new creation of
              photographic material shall be remunerated separately.
            </li>
            <li>
              To the extent that the client has to provide information, objects
              (e.g. products, goods), permits, etc. necessary for the production
              of the photographs or to perform other tasks relevant to the
              production of the photographs themselves (e.g. booking of photo
              models, locations or catering), the client shall ensure that the
              delivery, provision, access to locations, arrival of photo models,
              etc. takes place in good time so that the production of the
              photographs can begin on time. As soon as the client becomes aware
              that timely delivery, provision, access to the location, the
              arrival of models, etc. is not possible, they must notify the
              photographer immediately. If this results in a delay in the
              production of the photo shoot and the cause of the delay is within
              the client’s control, the client shall bear any costs incurred as
              a result of the delay (e.g. additional hotel accommodation,
              location days, bookings of models, make-up artists, assistants,
              rebooking).
            </li>
            <li>
              The client shall ensure that the persons to be photographed have
              given their consent to the production and publication of the
              photographic material. To this end, the client must provide
              corresponding written releases and make them available to the
              photographer upon request.
            </li>
            <li>
              Unless otherwise agreed, the photographer will select the
              photographs to be presented to the client for approval upon
              completion of the production.
            </li>
            <li>
              If no written complaint is received by the photographer within two
              weeks of delivery of the photographs, the photographs shall be
              deemed to have been accepted in accordance with the contract and
              to be free from defects.
            </li>

          Image material provided (analogue, digital, moving image)
          <ol className={styles.subList}>
            <li>
              The General Terms and Conditions apply to all image material
              (including audio) supplied to the client, regardless of the
              creative stage or technical form in which it is available.
            </li>
            <li>
              The copyright-relevant metadata contained in the files must not be
              altered or deleted by the client. The client must use appropriate
              technical means to ensure that this data is preserved during any
              data transfer, any transfer to other data carriers, any
              reproduction on a screen and any public reproduction.
            </li>
            <li>
              The client acknowledges that the photographic material supplied by
              the photographer is a photographic work protected by copyright
              under Section 2(1) (5) of the German Act on Copyright and Related
              Rights.
            </li>
            <li>
              The parties shall agree on the data format of the photographs. If
              no agreement is made, the photographer may specify a suitable data
              format. The provision of RAW files requires a separate agreement.
            </li>
            <li>
              The client may only provide images to third parties for internal
              business purposes of viewing, selection, and technical processing.
              The client must treat analogue imagery with care and
              consideration.
            </li>
            <li>
              Complaints about the content of the delivery or the content,
              quality or condition of the photographic material must be made
              within two weeks of receipt. Otherwise, the photographic material
              shall be deemed to have been received in good order, in accordance
              with the agreement and as recorded.
            </li>

          Rights of use
          <br />
          <br />
          a) Corporate assignments
          <br />
          <br />
          The client shall only acquire rights of use to the extent
          contractually agreed (quotation, assignment, framework agreement). If
          no such agreement has been made, the following shall apply:
          <ol className={styles.subList}>
            <li>
              Non-exclusive, unlimited time and space usage rights are granted
              for the client’s print and online media and social media profiles.
            </li>
            <li>
              The transfer and/or granting of the rights of use acquired by the
              client to third parties, even if these are group companies or
              subsidiaries, requires the prior written consent of the
              photographer. This also applies to any inclusion in and transfer
              to third party databases. The photographer is entitled to make the
              granting of consent to the planned use by third parties dependent
              on the payment of an appropriate licence fee.
            </li>
            <li>The photographer must be credited in all publications.</li>
            <li>
              The image material may not be used by the client or on behalf of
              the client for the purpose of AI learning and for the creation of
              new works using artificial intelligence.
            </li>
            <li>
              Even if the exclusive rights of use are transferred, the
              photographer retains the right to use their photos themselves or
              to have them used for self-promotional purposes.
            </li>
          </ol>
          b) Editorial assignments
          <br />
          <br />
          <ol className={styles.subList}>
            <li>
              The client shall only acquire rights of use to the extent
              contractually agreed (offer, assignment, framework agreement). If
              no agreement has been made, only a simple right of use shall be
              granted, for one-time use for the purpose specified by the client
              and in the publication and in the medium or data carrier specified
              by the client or resulting from the circumstances of the order
              placement. Unless otherwise agreed, publication on the Internet or
              inclusion in digital databases shall be limited in time to the
              duration of the publication period of the corresponding or a
              comparable print or online object.
            </li>
            <li>
              Exclusive rights of use, exclusive media or territorial rights or
              blocking periods must be agreed separately and require a surcharge
              of at least 100% on the respective basic fee.
            </li>
            <li>
              Any use, exploitation, reproduction, distribution, or publication
              of the photographic material beyond the scope of section IV b) 1
              is subject to a fee and requires the prior express consent of the
              photographer. This also applies to any inclusion in and transfer
              to third party databases.
            </li>
            <li>
              Alteration of the photographic material by photocomposing,
              montage, or electronic means to create a new copyrightable work is
              permitted only with the prior written consent of the photographer
              and only if marked [M]. Images may not be copied, photographed, or
              otherwise used as a motif. The image(s) may not be used by the
              client or on behalf of the client for the purpose of AI learning
              or the creation of new works using artificial intelligence.
            </li>
            <li>
              The client is not authorised to transfer the rights of use granted
              to them, in whole or in part, to third parties, including to other
              group companies or subsidiaries. Any use, reproduction or
              distribution of the image material is only permitted on condition
              that the copyright notice specified by the photographer is clearly
              attached to the image in question.
            </li>
            <li>
              The granting of the rights of use shall be subject to the
              condition precedent of full payment of all the photographer’s
              claims for remuneration arising from the contractual relationship
              in question.
            </li>
            <li>
              Even if the exclusive rights of use are transferred, the
              photographer retains the right to use their photos themselves or
              to have them used for self-promotional purposes and to use their
              photos for secondary utilisation after the expiry of an agreed
              blocking period.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
          Liability
          <ol className={styles.subList}>
            <li>
              The photographer accepts no liability for the infringement of any
              rights of any depicted trademarks (brands, company designs),
              persons or objects, unless a signed release form is supplied. The
              acquisition of rights of use beyond the photographic copyright,
              e.g. for depicted works of fine or applied art, as well as the
              obtaining of publication permissions from collections, museums,
              etc. are the responsibility of the client. The client is
              responsible for the text and the context resulting from the
              specific publication.
            </li>
            <li>
              The client is responsible for the proper use of the images from
              the time of delivery.
            </li>
            <li>
              The existence and/or possibility of re-delivery of the data is not
              the responsibility of the photographer.
            </li>
            <li>
              The photographer’s liability for damages shall be limited to the
              fee for the order in question. The parties reserve the right to
              prove that higher, lower or no damages have been incurred.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
          Fees and payment
          <ol className={styles.subList}>
            <li>
              The agreed fee applies. If no fee has been agreed, the fee shall
              be determined in accordance with the current overview of fees for
              image utilisation rights of the Mittelstandsgemeinschaft
              Foto-Marketing (MFM). The fee is subject to VAT at the applicable
              rate.
            </li>
            <li>
              Unless otherwise agreed, the agreed fee shall cover the one-off
              use of the photographic material for the agreed purpose in
              accordance with Clause IV b)1.
            </li>
            <li>
              Costs and expenses incurred as a result of the assignment (e.g.
              material and laboratory costs, model fees, costs for necessary
              props, travel costs, necessary expenses) are not included in the
              fee and shall be borne by the client.
            </li>
            <li>
              The fee is due on delivery of the material. If a production is
              delivered in parts, the corresponding partial fee shall be due
              with the respective delivery. The photographer is entitled to
              demand payment by instalments for production orders in accordance
              with the scope of services provided.
            </li>
            <li>
              The fee in accordance with VI 1 of the General Terms and
              Conditions shall be payable in full even if the commissioned and
              supplied photographic material is not published.
            </li>
            <li>
              Offsetting or the exercise of a right of retention is only
              permitted against undisputed or legally established claims of the
              client. Offsetting against disputed counterclaims that are ready
              for judgment is also permitted.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
          Sample copies
          <ol className={styles.subList}>
            <li>
              The client is obliged to send a sample copy (e.g. print, digital
              file, online link) to the photographer unsolicited and no later
              than 6 weeks after publication of the photographs.
            </li>

        <li>
          Contractual penalty, damages, cancellation fee
          <ol className={styles.subList}>
            <li>
              In the event of any unauthorised use, reproduction, or disclosure
              of the photographic material (without the photographer’s consent),
              a contractual penalty in the amount of twice the usage fee shall
              be payable for each instance, subject to further claims for
              damages.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the copyright notice is missing, incomplete, incorrectly placed
              or not assignable, a surcharge of 100% of the agreed or customary
              usage fee will be payable.
            </li>
            <li>
              If an order is cancelled for reasons for which the client is
              responsible, a cancellation fee will be charged. If the
              cancellation is made no later than 7 working days before the
              agreed date, the cancellation fee shall be 50% of the agreed fee.
              In the event of later cancellation, the full agreed fee shall be
              payable, including the fees of any vicarious agent (employees,
              models, stylists, make-up artists) already engaged.

              Ancillary agreements to the contract or to these General Terms and
